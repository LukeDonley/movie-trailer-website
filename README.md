The Movie Trailer Website is a page which displays a selection of movies, information about those movies and a trailer for each movie.

To use, download the three files from Github. The files are the following:

media.py
    This file defines the class Movie, which is the blueprint for each movie object

entertainment_center.py
    This file is where all Movie objects are initialized and all relevant data is defined. An array of Movie object is created, then the open_movies_page function is called, creating and launching the website.

fresh_tomatoes.py
    The page layout and style are defined in this file. Also defined are the create_movie_tiles_content function, which creates each movie tile, and the open_movies_page function, which creates and opens the website.

To run the code, execute entertainment_center.py with a Python interpreter.
